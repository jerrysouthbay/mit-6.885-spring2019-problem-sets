# MIT 6.885 Spring 2019 problem set 2: Metaprob

This repo contains the elements required for building containers for
authoring and solving the Metaprob problem set for 6.885

## Authoring



## Building

Currently, `make docker-build` will build the docker image intended for student use. That image can be pushed to DockerHub, where students will be able to download it.

## Student instructions

Instructions for the use of the Docker images by students are contained in `student-instructions.md`. Since this repository is private, those instructions should be made available to students via some other channel- either copy/pasted into other student-facing documentation, or made available as a file.
